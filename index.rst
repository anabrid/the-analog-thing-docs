   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to The Analog Thing Documentation's documentation!
==========================================================

This is the starting point for a new attempt of a documentation for `The Analog Thing <https://the-analog.thing.org>`_.
It is planned as a successor for the `current documentation wiki <https://the-analog-thing.org/wiki>`_, which will
be, after a transition period, either turned off or converted to a pure community-driven project.

The major advantage of this documentation system is that

- There is a **structure** imposed by the navigation **hierarchy**. This is fundamentally
  different to a wiki, where it requires continous effort to establish a strongly hierarchical
  content.
- Content is **authored by anabrid**. While the sources are supposed to be freely available at
  Github and people are invited to contribute corrections and improvements, they cannot directly
  edit but are asked to `put pull rqeuests on Github <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>`_.
  It is up on anabrid staff to either **accept or deny** these pull requests. This is a much
  more strict approach then on an (open) wiki where any edit is immediately live.

Let's start with a navigation hierarchy.
