Programming analog computers
============================

The programming of analog computers difference essentially to the known methods and procedures of programming a digital computer programmable from memory. To get a result of a given funktion the individual computing components of an analog computer have to be connected in a way which corresponds to the conditional equations of the problem to be solved. An analogon of the attended problem is made, while a digital computer requires the creation of an algorithm in an appropriate form for the computer.

In the following sections the basics of setting up calculation plans for electrical analog computers, as well as the usually unavoidable questions of normalization and time scaling, are dealt with. The usage of this basic programming techniques are demonstrated with help of some examples.
