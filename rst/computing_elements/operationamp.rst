Operation amplifier
===================

The **operation amplifier** is the most important electronic part in electrical analog computers.

The term *operation amplifier* was introduced and defined by *John Ragazzini* in 1947:

 "As an amplifier so connected can perform the mathematical operations of arithmetic and calculus on the voltages aookued ti its input, it is hereafter termed an *Operational Amplifier*."
 
In it's simplest form, the operation amplifier can be found in analog computers as so called *open amplifiers*, where the positive input is eleictrically grounded while it's negitave input is connected to a resistor. This is used to generate inverse functions (e.g. a multiplier in combination of an open amplifier functions as divider).
