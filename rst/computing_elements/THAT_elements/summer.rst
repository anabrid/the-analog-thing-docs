Summer

**INSERT IMAGES**

The **summer** is the simplest active computing part. As the name suggests, it gives out the sum of given inputs.

**Note: Due to technical reasons the output of a summer is inverted, so the equation: "output = - sum(inputs)" is fulfilled.**

On the basis of the output inversion a summer with one input functions as inverter and therefore summer and inverter share the same circuit symbol.
