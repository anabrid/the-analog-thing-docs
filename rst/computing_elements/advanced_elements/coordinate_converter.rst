Coordinate converter
====================

In many applications (especially in aerospace simulations) coordinate transformation e.g. Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinats is a common mathematical opertation.
Where it is possible to realize coordinate transformators with basic computing elements, it comes with the necessity to use computing elements that could be used elsewhere.

Therefore larger electrical analog computers often come with **coordinate coverters** as closed unit in order to simplify the programs to be simulated.
