This howto shall contain a step by step manual for converting LaTeX docu (.tex-files) to Sphinx (.rst-files).

Requires installation of pandoc.
Check out: https://pandoc.org/installing.html


1) execute on bash:

pandoc -s -t rst --toc input.tex -o output.rst

-> generates output.rst
   -> Know issues:
	- the figure and math objects commonly used to generate circuit plans cannot be converted by pandoc and therefore must be manually removed von the tex-files. When executing pandoc, the console outputs the line in the .tex file where the error occurs
	
2) copy generated .rst file and (!) it's corresponding images to sphinx folder and add it to the toctree.

3) screenshot the circuit plans (e.g. from .pdf file).

4) Try building and go through console errors, usually image pathes are broken.

5) Format acticle to beauty and don't forget to also format the references.

6) git it!
