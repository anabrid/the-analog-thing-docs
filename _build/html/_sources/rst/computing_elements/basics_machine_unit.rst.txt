The **THAT**, as most other electrical analog computers, can compute values in the range from -1 to +1. So every program needs to be checked if it exceeds +/-1 at any point. This check can also happen theoretically as well as experimentally. If a running programm exceeds +/-1, most analog computers will change into an overload state to protect the computing elemtents so no damage is to be expected. However the computing results are useless in case of overload.

The THAT indicates overload state with a red LED light with **OL** marked.

The **machine unit** is a technical variable and **represents the maximum voltage** which can be applied to the computing elements of an electrial analog computer.

The machine unit is system specific, the **THAT has a machine unit of +/- 10 volts.**

The CHINCH-outputs (x, y , z, u) have a 10 to 1 voltage divider so the results given by those outputs can only give values between -1 and +1.
